# Mindy Wunna

**Mindy Wunna** means "What is inside my mind." This is the front-end repository for the project, built using **Next.js**. State management is handled by **lifting state up**.

## Project Overview

- Mindy Wunna provides a conversational experience through a minimalist chat UI. When a user sends a message, it is transmitted to a backend API deployed on AWS Lambda, which processes the input and returns a relevant response. This project showcases seamless integration between a modern front-end (Next.js) and serverless backend.
