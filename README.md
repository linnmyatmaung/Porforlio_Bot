# [Porforlio_Bot]

[Porforlio_Bot] is inspired by the original project Mindy Wunna (created by wunnaaung-dev).  
This is my personal adaptation, built with **Next.js** and simple state management through lifting state up.

## Project Overview

[Porforlio_Bot] offers a minimalist chat interface designed for conversational interactions.  
Messages sent by users are processed by a backend API (https://linnmyatmaung-chatbot.onrender.com/chat) which generates appropriate responses.  
This project highlights seamless communication between a modern frontend (**Next.js**) and an express server backend.

## Features

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my skills, experiences, hobbies, or anything else.
- âœ¨ Clean and responsive chat UI.
- ðŸš€ Fast serverless backend integration.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone [https://github.com/linnmyatmaung/Porforlio_Bot.git]

# Install dependencies

# Start the development server

```

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** â€” React-based framework for front-end development.
